CS370 Lab4

This lab4 integrated the symbol table data structure into the yacc/lex calculator. Yacc takes in variable tokens and places them into the symbol table. The varible only gets inserted if it doesn't already exists. The program only finds integers and strings. Each variable can be assigned an integer value and saved into memory, once it has a value the variable can be used as an integer to do simple calculations. All declarations must be made before expressions. The program also has a max amount of variables that can be declared.
