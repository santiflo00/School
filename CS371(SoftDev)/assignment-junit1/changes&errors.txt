Circle.java
put an if statment to check if the factor for the scale funtion is not negative, if it is just return without changing anything
Also inside the scale function changed the plus(+) to multiply(*) to get correct scaling

Circle1.java
completly re did the intersects function. It was not finding all intersections. Changes similar to Circle2.java
intersects function now finds the bigger radius and saves it to find if the circles intersect

Circle2.java
The x and y values were switched inside the constructor  from super(y,x,radius); ->  super(x,y,radius);
The intersects function just needed to check with both radii instead of just one. It now adds the radius of both circles and compares with d
The intersects function now also checks if a circle is inside of it. If it is then they dont intersect
